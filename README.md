# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering: 
**Software engineering is a branch of computer science that emphasizes a holistic, systematic and disciplined approach to designing, developing and deploying a software system**

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming? 
**Sostware engineering is a disciplined and holistic approach to designing, developing, testing and deploying a software system.
Traditional programming is result oriented which majorly focuses in coding. Software engineering emphasizes collaboration to achieve the broad objectives of requirement analysis, low and high level design, coding, different levels of testing, deployment, maintenance and documentation in each and every stage whereas traditional programming majorly is a product of single developers**

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
**Software development life cycle is defines the process of planning, creating, developing, testing and deploying a software system.
The phases include: 
1 Problem Identification - This can result from need to replace the current manual system, request from stakeholders or need to update the current existing system.
2 Requirement analysis
3 Design
4 Coding
5 Testing
6 Deployment
7 Maintenance
8 Documentation**

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
**Agile model is a combination of iterative and incremental methodologies. It emphasizes the deployment of a working system then upgrading it incrementally.
Waterfall model is a rigid linear sequential model which emphasizes completion of a given phase before moving to the next.
Agile model is suitable in scenarios where user requirements can change over time while waterfall model is much suitable where the requirements are well defined and least expectedly that the requirements might change.**

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
**Requirement engineering the entire process of identifying, defining, analysing, documenting and maintaing software requirements.
The process include:
Elucidation - Gathering requirements from stakeholders
Analysing - Understanding and analyzing the requirements
specification - involves documenting the requirements ina clear and precise manner
Validation - ensrueing that the requirements meet stakeholders needs
Management - Tracking and managing changes to the requirements.
It's crucial in understanding what the software is suppose to do there by ensuring that user requirements are met.**

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
**Modularity is a software design principle which emphasizes the splitting of a soft into modules- smaller, manageable and indepent modules. These modules can be developed, tested and maintained separately. This helps in making the software system maintainable - easier to track and fix bugs in the indepenent modules, scalable - easier to add new features without interfering with the existing ones, and reuseable - can be reused across different projects.**

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
**Unit testing - this is testing that is subjected to independent modules to confirm if they are working as per the requirements.
Integration testing - Involves testing of integrated modules to affirm if whether they are working seamlessly
System testing - is a type of testing that is subjected to the entire system to ensure it's working as per the requirements
Acceptance testing - is a type of testing that the system is functioning as per the end user expectations and is ready for deployment.**

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
**Version control systems are software tools used by software teams to manage code over time. It assists multiple developers to collaborate, track changes and revert to privious version if need be.
Examples include GIT, Subversions and mercurial**

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
**A software project manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of a software product. Their reponsibilities are:
Planning: Defining project scope, objectives, and milestones.
Resource Allocation: Managing team roles, responsibilities, and resources.
Risk Management: Identifying and mitigating risks.
Communication: Ensuring clear communication among stakeholder
Some of the challenges they face are:
Scope Creep: Uncontrolled changes in project scope.
Resource Constraints: Managing limited resources and budgets.
Time Management: Delivering projects on time.**

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
**Software maintenance involves modifying and updating software after its initial release. Types of maintenance activities include:
Corrective: Fixing bugs and errors.
Adaptive: Updating the software to work in new or changed environments.
Perfective: Enhancing performance or adding new features.
Preventive: Improving maintainability and preventing future issues.
Maintenance is essential to ensure the software remains functional, secure, and relevant over time.**

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
**Ethical issues in software engineering might include:
Privacy: Ensuring user data is protected and not misused.
Security: Developing secure software to prevent data breaches.
Intellectual Property: Respecting copyrights and avoiding plagiarism.
Honesty: Being truthful about the capabilities and limitations of the software.
Software engineers can adhere to ethical standards by following professional codes of conduct, such as those provided by the ACM or IEEE, and by prioritizing user welfare and transparency in their work.**
